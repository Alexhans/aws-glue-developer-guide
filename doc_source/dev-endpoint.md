# Using Development Endpoints for Developing Scripts<a name="dev-endpoint"></a>

AWS Glue can create an environment for you to iteratively develop and test your extract, transform, and load \(ETL\) scripts\. You can develop your script in a notebook  and point to an AWS Glue endpoint to test it\. When you're satisfied with the results of your development process, you can create an ETL job that runs your script\. With this process, you can add functions and debug your script in an interactive manner\.

**Note**  
Your Python scripts must target Python 2\.7, because AWS Glue development endpoints do not support Python 3 yet\.

## Managing Your Development Environment<a name="dev-endpoint-actions"></a>

With AWS Glue, you can create, edit, and delete development endpoints\. You provide configuration values to provision the development environments\. These values tell AWS Glue how to set up the network so that you can access your development endpoint securely, and your endpoint can access your data stores\. Then, create a notebook that connects to the development endpoint, and use your notebook to author and test your ETL script\.

 For more information about managing a development endpoint using the AWS Glue console, see [Working with Development Endpoints on the AWS Glue Console](console-development-endpoint.md)\. 

## How to Use a Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-workflow"></a>

To use a development endpoint, you can follow this workflow\.

1. Create an AWS Glue development endpoint through the console or API\. This endpoint is launched in your virtual private cloud \(VPC\) with your defined security groups\.

1. The console or API can poll the development endpoint until it is provisioned and ready for work\. When it's ready, you can connect to the development endpoint to create and test AWS Glue scripts\.
   + You can install an Apache Zeppelin notebook on your local machine, connect it to a development endpoint, and then develop on it using your browser\.
   + You can create an Apache Zeppelin notebook server in its own Amazon EC2 instance in your account using the AWS Glue console, and then connect to it using your browser\. For more information about how to create a notebbook server, see [Creating a Notebook Server Associated with a Development Endpoint](dev-endpoint-notebook-server-considerations.md)\. 
   + You can create an Amazon SageMaker notebook server in your account using the AWS Glue console\. For more information about how to create a notebbook, see [Working with Notebooks on the AWS Glue Console](console-notebooks.md)\. 
   + You can open a terminal window to connect directly to a development endpoint\.
   + If you have the Professional edition of the JetBrains [PyCharm Python IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), you can connect it to a development endpoint and use it to develop interactively\. PyCharm can then support remote breakpoints if you insert `pydevd` statements in your script\.

1. When you finish debugging and testing on your development endpoint, you can delete it\.

## Accessing Your Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-elastic-ip"></a>

When you create a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), AWS Glue returns only a private IP address, and the public IP address field is not populated\. When you create a non\-VPC development endpoint, AWS Glue returns only a public IP address\.

If your development endpoint has a **Public address**, then confirm it is reachable with the SSH private key for the development endpoint\. For example:

```
ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@public-address
```

 If your development endpoint has a **Private address** and your VPC subnet is routable from the public internet and its security groups allow inbound access from your client, then you can follow these instructions to attach an **elastic IP** to a development endpoint, thereby allowing access from the internet\.

**Note**  
To use elastic IPs, the subnet being used requires an internet gateway associated through the route table\.

1. On the AWS Glue console, navigate to the development endpoint details page\. Record the **Private address** for use in the next step\. 

1. On the Amazon EC2 console, navigate to **Network and Security**, then choose **Network Interfaces**\. Search for the **Private DNS \(IPv4\)** that corresponds to the **Private address** in the AWS Glue console development endpoint details page\. You might need to modify which columns are displayed in your Amazon EC2 console\. Note the **Network interface ID** \(ENI\) for this address\. For example `eni-12345678`\.

1. On the Amazon EC2 console, navigate to **Network and Security**, then choose **Elastic IPs**\. Choose **Allocate new address**, then **Allocate** to allocate a new elastic IP\.

1. On the **Elastic IPs** page, choose the newly allocated **Elastic IP**\. Then choose **Actions**, **Associate address**\.

1. On the **Associate address** page make the following choices:
   + For **Resource type**, choose **Network interface**\.
   + In the **Network interface** field, type the **Network interface ID** \(ENI\) for the private address\.
   + Choose **Associate**\.

1. Confirm if the newly associated **Elastic IP** is reachable with the SSH private key associated with the development endpoint\. For example: 

   ```
   ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@elastic-ip
   ```
