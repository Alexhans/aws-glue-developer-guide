# Security in AWS Glue<a name="security-glue"></a>

You can manage your AWS Glue resources and your data stores by using authentication, access control, and encryption\. 

Use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies to assign permissions and control access to AWS Glue resources\.

AWS Glue also enables you to encrypt data, logs, and bookmarks using keys that you manage with AWS KMS\. You can configure ETL jobs and development endpoints to use AWS KMS keys to write encrypted data at rest\. Additionally, you can use AWS KMS keys to encrypt the logs generated by crawlers and ETL jobs, as well as, encrypt ETL job bookmarks\. With AWS Glue, you can also encrypt the metadata stored in the Data Catalog with keys that you manage with AWS KMS\. 

The following examples describe some of the methods you can use for secure processing\. 
+ Use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies to assign permissions that determine who is allowed to manage AWS Glue resources\. For more information, see [Identity\-Based Policies \(IAM Policies\) For Access Control](using-identity-based-policies.md)\.
+ Use AWS Glue resource policies to control access to Data Catalog resources and grant cross\-account access without using an IAM role\. For more information, see [AWS Glue Resource Policies For Access Control](glue-resource-policies.md)\.
+ Use security configurations to encrypt your Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and job bookmarks data at rest\. For more information, see [Encrypting Data Written by Crawlers, Jobs, and Development Endpoints](encryption-security-configuration.md)\.
+ Only connect to JDBC data stores with trusted Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) connections\. For more information, see [Working with Connections on the AWS Glue Console](console-connections.md)\.
+ Encrypt your AWS Glue Data Catalog\. For more information, see [Encrypting Your Data Catalog](encrypt-glue-data-catalog.md)\.
+ Use the security features of your database engine to control who can log in to the databases on a database instance, just as you might do with a database on your local network\.

**Important**  
To use fine\-grained access control with the Data Catalog and Athena, consider the following limitations:  
You must [upgrade](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/glue-upgrade.html) from an Athena\-managed Data Catalog to the AWS Glue Data Catalog\.
Athena does not support cross\-account access to an AWS Glue Data Catalog\.
You cannot limit access to individual partitions within a table\. You can only limit access to databases and entire tables\.
When limiting access to a specific database in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you must also specify a default database for each AWS Region\. If you use Athena and the AWS Glue Data Catalog in more than one region, add a resource ARN for each default database in each region\. For example, to allow `GetDatabase` access to `example_db` in the `us-east-1` Region, include the `default` database in the policy as well:  

  ```
  {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
        "glue:GetDatabase"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:123456789012:database/default",
       "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:123456789012:database/example_db",
       "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:123456789012:catalog"     
     ]
   }
  ```
