# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitor-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor AWS Glue using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from AWS Glue into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information for a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, AWS Glue metric data is sent to CloudWatch automatically\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*, and [AWS Glue Metrics](monitoring-awsglue-with-cloudwatch-metrics.md#awsglue-metrics)\.
