# Adding Jobs in AWS Glue<a name="add-job"></a>

A job consists of the business logic that performs extract, transform, and load \(ETL\) work in AWS Glue\. You can monitor job runs to understand runtime metrics such as success, duration, and start time\. The output of a job is your transformed data, written to a location that you specify\.

Job runs can be initiated by triggers that start a job when they fire\. A job contains a script that connects to your source data, processes your data using the script's logic, and then writes it out to your data target\. Your job can have multiple data sources and multiple data targets\. You can use scripts that are generated by AWS Glue to transform data, or you can provide your own\. The AWS Glue code generator can automatically create an Apache Spark API \(PySpark\) script given a source schema and target location or schema\. You can use this script as a starting point and edit it to meet your goals\.

AWS Glue can write output files in several data formats, including JSON, CSV, ORC \(Optimized Row Columnar\), Apache Parquet, and Apache Avro\. For some data formats, common compression formats can be written\. 

## Defining Job Properties<a name="create-job"></a>

When you define your job in the [AWS Glue console](console-jobs.md), you provide the following information to control the AWS Glue runtime environment:

**IAM role**  
Specify the IAM role that is used for authorization to resources used to run the job and access data stores\. For more information about permissions for running jobs in AWS Glue, see [Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your AWS Glue Resources](access-control-overview.md)\.

**Generated or custom script**  
The code in the ETL script defines your job's procedural logic\. The script can be coded in Python or Scala\. You can choose whether the script that the job runs is generated by AWS Glue or provided by you\. You provide the script name and location in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\. Confirm that there isn't a file with the same name as the script directory in the path\. To learn more about using scripts, see [Editing Scripts in AWS Glue](edit-script.md)\.

**Scala class name**  
If the script is coded in Scala, a class name must be provided\. The default class name for AWS Glue generated scripts is **GlueApp**\.

**Temporary directory**  
Provide the location of a working directory in Amazon S3 where temporary intermediate results are written when AWS Glue runs the script\. Confirm that there isn't a file with the same name as the temporary directory in the path\. This directory is used when AWS Glue reads and writes to Amazon Redshift and by certain AWS Glue transforms\.

**Job bookmark**  
Specify how AWS Glue processes state information when the job runs\. You can have it remember previously processed data, update state information, or ignore state information\.

**Job metrics**  
Enable or disable the creation of CloudWatch metrics when this job runs\. To see profiling data this option must be enabled\. For more information about how to enable and visualize metrics, see [Job Monitoring and Debugging](monitor-profile-glue-job-cloudwatch-metrics.md)\. 

**Server\-side encryption**  
If you select this option, when the ETL job writes to Amazon S3, the data is encrypted at rest using SSE\-S3 encryption\. Both your Amazon S3 data target and any data that is written to an Amazon S3 temporary directory is encrypted\. For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server\-Side Encryption with Amazon S3\-Managed Encryption Keys \(SSE\-S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)\.

**Script libraries**  
If your script requires it, you can specify locations for the following:   
+ Python library path
+ Dependent jars path
+ Referenced files path
You can define the comma\-separated Amazon S3 paths for these libraries when you define a job\. You can override these paths when you run the job\. For more information, see [Providing Your Own Custom Scripts](console-custom-created.md)\.

**Concurrent DPUs per job run**  
A data processing unit \(DPU\) is a relative measure of processing power that is used by a job\. Choose an integer from 2 to 100\. The default is 10\. A single DPU provides processing capacity that consists of 4 vCPUs compute and 16 GB of memory\.   

**Max concurrency**  
Sets the maximum number of concurrent runs that are allowed for this job\. The default is 1\. An error is returned when this threshold is reached\. The maximum value you can specify is controlled by a service limit\. For example, if a previous run of a job is still running when a new instance is started, you might want to return an error to prevent two instances of the same job from running concurrently\. 

**Job timeout**  
Sets the maximum execution time in minutes\. The default is 2880 minutes\. If this limit is greater than the execution time, the job run state changes to “TIMEOUT”\. 

**Delay notification threshold**  
Sets the threshold \(in minutes\) before a delay notification is sent\. You can set this threshold to send notifications when a `RUNNING`, `STARTING`, or `STOPPING` job run takes more than an expected number of minutes\.

**Number of retries**  
Specify the number of times, from 0 to 10, that AWS Glue should automatically restart the job if it fails\.

**Job parameters**  
A set of key\-value pairs that are passed as named parameters to the script invoked by the job\. These are default values that are used when the script is run, but you can override them at run time\. The key name is prefixed with `--`, for example `--myKey` and the value is `value-for-myKey`\.   

```
'--myKey' : 'value-for-myKey'  
```
For more examples, see Python parameters in [Passing and Accessing Python Parameters in AWS Glue](aws-glue-programming-python-calling.md#aws-glue-programming-python-calling-parameters)\.

**Target path**  
For Amazon S3 target locations, provide the location of a directory in Amazon S3 where your output is written when AWS Glue runs the script\. Confirm that there isn't a file with the same name as the target path directory in the path\.
